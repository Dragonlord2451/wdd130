      <h3>Cybersecurity Basics</h3>
      <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks, unauthorized access, and damage. In todays increasingly digital world, where everything from banking to communication happens online, understanding cybersecurity basics is crucial to protecting personal information, securing data, and maintaining privacy.

        Key Concepts in Cybersecurity
        
        Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad)
        
        Confidentiality ensures that sensitive data is accessed only by authorized users.
        Integrity refers to the accuracy and consistency of data, ensuring that information is not altered or tampered with.
        Availability guarantees that information and systems are accessible when needed by authorized users.
        Authentication and Authorization
        
        Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or device, typically through methods like passwords, biometrics, or two-factor authentication.
        Authorization is the process of granting or denying access to resources based on the authenticated identity.
        Encryption
        
        Encryption transforms data into a coded format to prevent unauthorized access. Even if an attacker intercepts the data, they will not be able to understand it without the decryption key.</p>
