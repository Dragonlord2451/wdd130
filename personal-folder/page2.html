            <h2>Cybersecurity Basics Overview</h2>
            <p>
                [At its core, cybersecurity involves various techniques, tools, and best practices to defend against threats like malware, hacking, phishing, and data breaches. Key components of cybersecurity include concepts like the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability), secure authentication, proper authorization, and encryption to keep data safe from prying eyes.

                As cyber threats continue to evolve, cybersecurity plays a vital role in protecting the confidentiality of data, ensuring the integrity of systems, and maintaining the availability of information resources. This requires a combination of technical measures, user awareness, and constant vigilance.]

                    CIA Triad
                    The CIA Triad is a foundational model in cybersecurity that helps organizations understand and protect their digital assets. It consists of three core components:
                    
                    Confidentiality:
                    
                    Ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to those authorized to view it.
                    Techniques include encryption, access control, and classification of data.
                    Example: Encrypting data so that only those with the correct decryption key can read it.
                    Integrity:
                    
                    Ensures that information is accurate, consistent, and unaltered by unauthorized parties.
                    Techniques include hashing, digital signatures, and version control.
                    Example: Using checksums to verify that a file has not been tampered with during transfer.
                    Availability:
                    
                    Ensures that information and resources are available to authorized users when needed.
                    Techniques include redundant systems, backups, and maintaining uptime through robust network design.
                    Example: Using load balancers to distribute traffic and prevent a server from crashing. .

                <h3>Real-Life Examples and Details</h3>
                <p>
                    <img src="download-_3_.png">
                    Data Breaches and the Importance of the CIA Triad
                    Example: The 2017 Equifax data breach exposed sensitive information of 147 million people, including Social Security numbers and addresses.
                    Details: This incident highlighted the significance of the CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability). Equifax's failure to patch a known vulnerability led to the breach, compromising Confidentiality (keeping data private). Such cases emphasize the need for proper cybersecurity measures to ensure that sensitive data remains secure.
                    2. Ransomware Attacks and Encryption
                    Example: In 2021, the Colonial Pipeline was hit by a ransomware attack that halted operations and led to fuel shortages in the U.S.
                    Details: Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim’s data and demands a ransom to decrypt it. This example underscores the importance of Encryption in both offensive and defensive contexts—hackers use encryption to hold data hostage, while defenders need robust encryption protocols to secure data.
                    3. Authentication and Authorization in Everyday Technology
                    Example: Two-factor authentication (2FA) is now widely used by platforms like Google and Microsoft to secure user accounts.
                    Details: Authentication verifies a user's identity (e.g., using passwords and biometrics), while Authorization determines what resources an authenticated user can access. Implementing 2FA adds a second layer of security, making it more challenging for attackers to breach accounts.
                    4. DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) Attacks
                    Example: In 2016, the Dyn DNS attack, carried out using the Mirai botnet, disrupted major websites like Twitter, Netflix, and Reddit.
                    Details: A DDoS attack overwhelms a server or network with a flood of internet traffic, making it unavailable. This attack highlighted the necessity of robust network security practices and defenses like load balancers and web application firewalls (WAF). .
